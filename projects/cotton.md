summary: "Making a dnd Campaign for my friend"
---

I don’t have links for this but I did run dnd campaign changing its rules, making a world with interacting characters and a small system where players got to pick which mission their wanted to go on. Missions that wasn’t pick progress so players had to make a decisions going into each session.

Having to figure out peoples schedules to run a session and figure what each player wanted out it, so I can help tailor encounters to them. Add lore to mana system rewriting and reworking it as I wanted to add new elements till I settled on a system I like. Trying to figure rewards for players that felt rewarding since it was a more sandboxing game and almost all players were new so explaining the rules to them in digestible chunks
