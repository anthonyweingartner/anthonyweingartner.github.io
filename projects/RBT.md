Becoming an RBT (registered behavior technician). A person that works with autistic children. I had to get certification studying for test and passing it then going onboarding training. It was a very stressful that I did with another job as with school as well. I eventually stop the job due to workload it was and other issues. 

That job requires a lot of patience and compassion. Which wasnâ€™t hard for me due to not feeling negative feeling towards my clients due to them being children and I knew the clients were their best. I tried this job due to me wanting to test if I could make in the mental health field and I believe I can. If I choose to get masters in that field later in life and go back I might however I enjoy working with code much more I believe.
