 a minecraft mod that is a work in progress. I wanted to make a gekko mod for my friend who likes gekko for valorant. I wanted to make him a little dizzy that he can throw and acts like a mini ghast. So far I have learned to make the actual Minecraft item and worked on a block bench mob. 

I learned how to use more jgrasp and make assets on block bench. I stop doing the mod for a bit due to personal matter but it is something I want to finish for my friend and is a great learning experience.
