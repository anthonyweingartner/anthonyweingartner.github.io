Ever since I young I had trouble learning. I had a terrible speech impediment and a slow time learning. I was put in extra help class and had a hard time understanding my people's emotions. I had to put a lot of effort to understand emotions and show off my own due to having a hard time understanding. Also I love math but I was terrible at learning but with small steps forward studying I got better at it. Towards the end of middle school I was put in regular classes with a extra help teacher. At the middle of high school I was put in advance math classes. It was very hard and felt like I made no progress compared to the other students. Yet struggle is what helps molds a person into who their are.

Small gains is something I live by because it is how life works. You take small steps forward and its very hard at first. Yet with each step its slightly  easier. Even if you are pushed down getting back up the first time feels draining, but each time you do it. Its get easier and easier to do. Its something that I knew a lot growing up, but to be honest its something I forgot recently due many things in my life. Its something I relearning to do, but now I am also taking small steps in other wise. Going to the gym more and more. Making sure to talk to friends more and make more since success is based on how happy you are. You can be burnt that's the problem with big steps. So take small steps and enjoy how far you have come.
