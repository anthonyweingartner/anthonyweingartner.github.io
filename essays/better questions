When asking questions it's often best to try and figure it out yourself. Try your best not to ask simple questions on forms mostly because you can be ignored and googling is usually faster. 
It's best to try and work on the problem by doing whatever research you can. I learn this a lot by making some simple games on godot, unity and learning fighting games as well. For fighting games I looked at certain characters, frame data and guides. 
I try to seriously figure out the problem first then give it a day usually trying to use rubber ducky technique. After exhausting my options I go to a specific form. In this case it was the skull girls' discord to try and figure out an issue I had when punishing a certain move and combo paths.

Doing this is amazing for you and the community since you get to learn something new while not being so reliant on everyone. It's not bad to rely on people but doing it too much can make both sides terrible.
You are wasting a lot of people's time not letting them help others and your questions are so simple or worse so unfocused it's hard to even answer. Try your best to explain what is wrong and how exactly it's going bad. A lot of people like to help each other. 
One bad example is someone in a fighting game just saying I canâ€™t do this combo please help me. A better example would be doing this person combo at this move. What am I doing wrong at this part? The best person is being specific and trying your best to look at other resources first and asking.
Even better to post the question to the right area
